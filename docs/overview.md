## assembly overview 
B - Define Byte. 8 bits

DW - Define Word. Generally 2 bytes on a typical x86 32-bit system

DD - Define double word.


##Â x86 overview
there are 8, 16, and 32 bit general registers

they are named a, b, c, d

| a | c | d | b 

low, high 

8-bit general registers: AL is 0, CL is 1, DL is 2, BL is 3, AH is 4, CH is 5, DH is 6, and BH is 7.

16-bit general registers: AX is 0, CX is 1, DX is 2, BX is 3, SP is 4, BP is 5, SI is 6, and DI is 7.

32-bit general registers: EAX is 0, ECX is 1, EDX is 2, EBX is 3, ESP is 4, EBP is 5, ESI is 6, and EDI is 7.

Segment registers: ES is 0, CS is 1, SS is 2, DS is 3, FS is 4, and GS is 5.

{Floating-point registers}: ST0 is 0, ST1 is 1, ST2 is 2, ST3 is 3, ST4 is 4, ST5 is 5, ST6 is 6, and ST7 is 7.

64-bit MMX registers: MM0 is 0, MM1 is 1, MM2 is 2, MM3 is 3, MM4 is 4, MM5 
is 5, MM6 is 6, and MM7 is 7.

Control registers: CR0 is 0, CR2 is 2, CR3 is 3, and CR4 is 4.

Debug registers: DR0 is 0, DR1 is 1, DR2 is 2, DR3 is 3, DR6 is 6, and DR7 is 7.

Test registers: TR3 is 3, TR4 is 4, TR5 is 5, TR6 is 6, and TR7 is 7

AX multiply/divide, string load & store

CX count for string operations & shifts

DX port address for IN and OUT

BX index register for MOVE

SP points to top of the stack

BP points to base of the stack frame

SI points to a source in stream operations

DI points to a destination in stream operations
