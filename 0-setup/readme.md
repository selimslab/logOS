## Setup 

we need a way to view our OS as it grows. A way is to boot a small computer like a raspberry pi or arduino. A simpler way is to use an emulator. Here we use [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) 

For assembler we will use [Netwide Assembler- nasm](https://www.nasm.us/)

### macOS
 `brew install qemu nasm`

### linux 
use your own package manager
