it is a simple OS from scratch

It is able to boot, use screen and keyboard, and get user input. It has a simple shell. Maybe it will have a filesystem later.

It is 32 bit and the assembly core is written for x86. 


## Development 

It is developed in steps. Every step has its folder, and adds a little bit on the previous step 

All you need is a mac or linux. You only need to install qemu for simulating the OS,  nasm for assembly and a C compiler to compile the kernel. Installation commands are in their relevant steps.  

There is an overview for assembly and x86 in docs/ folder 


## resources

The bootloader part is largely from Prof. Blundell's book [Writing a Simple Operating System â€” from Scratch ](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)


Interrupt code is largely from [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial)  

I have re-written, commented, and simplified
